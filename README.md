<h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>This webpage will be a demonstration of the skills that I have learned over HTML in the Odin Project course. It will display my abilities to create a well formatted webpage with the use of HTML boilerplate, elements, attributes, etc. I plan to introduce 3 different recipes with associated elements including but not limited to images, text, and links. At the end of this project, I hope to hone my skills and show my knowledge in the HTML language.</p>
